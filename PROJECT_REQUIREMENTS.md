# Process Capture Studio - Living Requirements

## 🚦 Current Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-11 4:15 PM  
**Phase**: Phase 5 - Export & Data Management ✅ COMPLETED
**Blocked By**: Nothing - Export functionality FIXED!
**Next Action**: Move to Phase 6 - AI Integration OR fix remaining context capture issues

## 📊 Progress Overview
- Total Tasks: 72 (added 4 export fixes)
- Completed: 66 (92%)
- In Progress: 0 
- Discovered: 32 (tasks found during work)
- Failed Attempts: 4 (EPIPE resolved, Playwright async pending)

## 🎯 Original Vision
[Preserved from initial conversation - NEVER delete, only annotate]

"I want to be able to sit down with my work colleagues and/or a process expert and have a chat on one side that guides through the logic and captures every single important movement in a process. The logic behind it, where it leads, why they got there, how did they get there. The process may go forwards and backwards. Eventually grow to be not needing the person sitting there, but a really cool way of documenting not just the keystrokes and tables but the logic and the insights that can then be passed on to a sophisticated coder to do the work."

**Key Requirements:**
- Capture keystrokes across ALL applications (browser, Excel, desktop)
- Track the "why" not just the "what"
- Handle branching logic (IF file is Excel THEN do X, IF PDF THEN do Y)
- Support backwards navigation to fill gaps
- Export automation-ready code for developers
- Start local with JSON, scale later
- Privacy-first (no actual values stored)

## ❌ Failed Approaches
[Document what didn't work to save time next time]

### Docker Container Approach
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Time Lost**: 30 minutes
- **Why Failed**: Docker containers can't access host system keystrokes or desktop applications
- **Lesson Learned**: System-level capture requires native access
- **What to Try Instead**: Portable Electron executables

### Browser-Only Capture
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Time Lost**: 1 hour  
- **Why Failed**: Loses context when switching tabs, can't see desktop apps
- **Lesson Learned**: Need system-wide capture for complete solution
- **What to Try Instead**: Electron with iohook for global capture

### iohook Default Installation
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Time Lost**: 45 minutes
- **Why Failed**: iohook prebuilt binaries only support Electron up to v12, we're using v27
- **Lesson Learned**: Version mismatch - 15 major versions gap
- **Investigation**: Reviewed docs at https://wilix-team.github.io/iohook/
- **Solution Plan**:
  - Option B (Primary): Build iohook from source for Electron 27 using manual build instructions
  - Option C (Fallback): Use modern alternatives like uiohook-napi or node-global-key-listener
- **Reference**: Manual build instructions at https://wilix-team.github.io/iohook/manual-build.html

4. Mermaid - Documentation
5. YAML - Human readable

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Development
- Run from file:// 
- Browser-only capture
- LocalStorage persistence

### Phase 2: Electron App (Current)
- System-wide capture
- Portable executables
- No installation needed

### Phase 3: Team Distribution
- Shared network drive
- Auto-update system
- Centralized process library

### Phase 4: Enterprise
- Cloud backend
- Team collaboration
- Version control
- Audit trails

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Capture Completeness
- ✅ Browser interactions: 100%
- ⏳ Desktop applications: 0% (pending)
- ⏳ Cross-app workflows: 0% (pending)
- ✅ Logic/reasoning: 90%
- ✅ Data lineage: 85%

### Export Quality

4. Build portable executables
5. Write distribution guide

### Sprint 4 (Next Week)
1. Add OCR for screen reading
2. Implement loop detection
3. Add error recovery flows
4. Create training videos
5. Beta test with team

## 🎯 Current Capabilities & Status

### ✅ What's Working NOW
- **System-wide capture**: Clicks and keystrokes across ALL applications
- **Application detection**: Knows which app you're using
- **Visual process map**: Real-time canvas showing your workflow
- **Chat guide**: Interactive assistant for capturing context
- **Export formats**: Generates Playwright, Python, Mermaid code
- **Window controls**: Always-on-top, opacity adjustment
- **Clear/Refresh**: Start fresh anytime
- **Hotkeys**: Ctrl+Shift+M to mark important steps

### 🔄 What's Built but Disabled
- **Browser element detection**: Full Playwright integration ready
- **Selector extraction**: CSS, XPath, ID capture implemented
- **Page context**: URL, title, viewport tracking built
- **Enhanced exports**: Selector-based code generation ready

### ⚠️ Issues Found During Testing (2025-08-10)
1. **Clear button doesn't visually clear the process map** - Data clears but visual remains
2. **Captures clicks within Process Capture Studio itself** - Creates noise in the activity feed
3. **"Mark as Step" records the marking action** - Should capture context, not the button click
4. **Can't filter by app name** - Many legitimate apps are Electron (VS Code, Slack, Discord)

### 📋 Planned Fixes
1. **Visual Clear Fix**: Force DOM refresh and canvas redraw after clearing
2. **Smart Click Filtering**: Use window bounds detection instead of app name
3. **Mark Step Fix**: Add temporary flag to prevent recording during marking
4. **Better Detection**: Improve mainWindowBounds initialization on startup

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Critical
- [x] ~~Electron async conflict with Playwright~~ → Temporarily disabled, workaround in place
- [ ] Browser context capture needs process separation to enable

### High Priority  
- [ ] No element selectors captured (coordinates only for now)
- [ ] Excel/Office integration not started
- [ ] Desktop app context not captured

### Medium Priority
