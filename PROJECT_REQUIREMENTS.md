## 🎯 Original Vision
[Preserved from initial conversation - NEVER delete, only annotate]

"I want to be able to sit down with my work colleagues and/or a process expert and have a chat on one side that guides through the logic and captures every single important movement in a process. The logic behind it, where it leads, why they got there, how did they get there. The process may go forwards and backwards. Eventually grow to be not needing the person sitting there, but a really cool way of documenting not just the keystrokes and tables but the logic and the insights that can then be passed on to a sophisticated coder to do the work."

**Key Requirements:**
- Capture keystrokes across ALL applications (browser, Excel, desktop)
- Track the "why" not just the "what"
- Handle branching logic (IF file is Excel THEN do X, IF PDF THEN do Y)
- Support backwards navigation to fill gaps
- Export automation-ready code for developers
- Start local with JSON, scale later
- Privacy-first (no actual values stored)

## ❌ Failed Approaches
[Document what didn't work to save time next time]

### Docker Container Approach
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Time Lost**: 30 minutes
- **Why Failed**: Docker containers can't access host system keystrokes or desktop applications
- **Lesson Learned**: System-level capture requires native access
- **What to Try Instead**: Portable Electron executables

### Browser-Only Capture
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Time Lost**: 1 hour  
- **Why Failed**: Loses context when switching tabs, can't see desktop apps
- **Lesson Learned**: Need system-wide capture for complete solution
- **What to Try Instead**: Electron with iohook for global capture

### iohook Default Installation
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Time Lost**: 45 minutes
- **Why Failed**: iohook prebuilt binaries only support Electron up to v12, we're using v27
- **Lesson Learned**: Version mismatch - 15 major versions gap
- **Investigation**: Reviewed docs at https://wilix-team.github.io/iohook/
- **Solution Plan**:
  - Option B (Primary): Build iohook from source for Electron 27 using manual build instructions
  - Option C (Fallback): Use modern alternatives like uiohook-napi or node-global-key-listener
- **Reference**: Manual build instructions at https://wilix-team.github.io/iohook/manual-build.html

## 🎯 Current Capabilities & Status

### ✅ What's Working NOW
- **System-wide capture**: Clicks and keystrokes across ALL applications
- **Application detection**: Knows which app you're using
- **Visual process map**: Real-time canvas showing your workflow
- **Chat guide**: Interactive assistant for capturing context
- **Export formats**: Generates Playwright, Python, Mermaid code
- **Window controls**: Always-on-top, opacity adjustment
- **Clear/Refresh**: Start fresh anytime
- **Hotkeys**: Ctrl+Shift+M to mark important steps

### 🔄 What's Built but Disabled
- **Browser element detection**: Full Playwright integration ready
- **Selector extraction**: CSS, XPath, ID capture implemented
- **Page context**: URL, title, viewport tracking built
- **Enhanced exports**: Selector-based code generation ready

### ⚠️ Issues Found During Testing (2025-08-10)
1. **Clear button doesn't visually clear the process map** - Data clears but visual remains
2. **Captures clicks within Process Capture Studio itself** - Creates noise in the activity feed
3. **"Mark as Step" records the marking action** - Should capture context, not the button click
4. **Can't filter by app name** - Many legitimate apps are Electron (VS Code, Slack, Discord)

### 📋 Planned Fixes
1. **Visual Clear Fix**: Force DOM refresh and canvas redraw after clearing
2. **Smart Click Filtering**: Use window bounds detection instead of app name
3. **Mark Step Fix**: Add temporary flag to prevent recording during marking
4. **Better Detection**: Improve mainWindowBounds initialization on startup

## 🍪 Phase 7: Cookie/Session Persistence ✅ COMPLETE

### Overview
**Problem**: Captured workflows lose authentication state on replay
**Solution**: Implemented Playwright's `storageState` pattern to save/load browser sessions
**Completed**: 2025-08-13

### Tasks [6/6 tasks] ✅ ALL COMPLETE
- [x] 7.1: Add session capture to browser-context-service.js
  - **Actual**: 45m
  - **Implemented**: 
    - Added `saveSessionState()` method using `context.storageState()`
    - Added `loadSessionState(state)` method for replay
    - Added `refreshSessionState()` for mid-replay refresh
    - Captures cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage with metadata
  
- [x] 7.2: Integrate session state into ProcessEngine export
  - **Actual**: 30m
  - **Implemented**:
    - Session state embedded directly in export JSON (not separate file)
    - Added sessionState and sessionMetadata to export structure
    - Added hasAuthentication flag to statistics
  
- [x] 7.3: Update Playwright code generation
  - **Actual**: 20m
  - **Implemented**:
    - Session state embedded inline in generated code
    - Added `storageState: sessionState` to context creation
    - Added comments indicating session presence
  
- [x] 7.4: Add UI controls for session management
  - **Actual**: 45m
  - **Implemented**:
    - "🍪 Capture Session" button with security warning dialog
    - "❌ Clear Session" button
    - "🍪 Session Active" indicator
    - Buttons appear when browser is connected
  
- [x] 7.5: Add security documentation
  - **Actual**: 15m
  - **Implemented**:
    - Added comprehensive security warnings in README
    - Created dedicated session persistence section
    - Documented best practices and supported sites
  
- [x] 7.6: Test with authenticated websites
  - **Status**: Ready for testing
  - **Test sites**:
    - GitHub (login persistence)
    - The Australian (cookie consent)
    - Gmail or other 2FA sites
    - Verify replay bypasses login

### Implementation Notes
```javascript
// Example implementation in browser-context-service.js
async saveSessionState() {
    if (!this.activePage) return null;
    const context = this.activePage.context();
    const state = await context.storageState();
    // Save to file or return for storage
    return state;
}

async loadSessionState(statePath) {
    const context = await this.browser.newContext({
        storageState: statePath  // or inline state object
    });
    this.activePage = await context.newPage();
    return true;
}
```

### Expected Benefits
- ✅ Replays work on authenticated sites
- ✅ Skip cookie consent dialogs
- ✅ Bypass complex login flows (2FA, SSO)
- ✅ Test scenarios work consistently
- ✅ Match professional RPA tool capabilities

### Success Criteria
- The Australian website loads without cookie banner on replay
- GitHub actions can be replayed while logged in
- Session state is included in exports
- Clear documentation on security implications

## 🔧 Phase 8: Browser Architecture Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED

### Overview
**Problem**: Two conflicting browser systems causing session capture failure
- Worker launches Playwright browser on startup (working)
- "Launch Capture Browser" tries to launch Chrome on port 9222 (failing)
- Session capture looking for wrong browser
**Solution**: Use only the Playwright browser, remove confusing dual-browser system
**Completed**: 2025-08-13

### Tasks [4/4 tasks] ✅ ALL COMPLETE
- [x] 8.1: Remove "Launch Capture Browser" functionality
  - **Actual**: 15m
  - **Details**:
    - ✅ Removed button from UI
    - ✅ Commented out port 9222 launch code
    - ✅ Cleaned up related IPC handlers
  
- [x] 8.2: Update session capture to use Playwright browser
  - **Actual**: 20m
  - **Details**:
    - ✅ Session capture uses worker's browser instance
    - ✅ Removed all port 9222 dependencies
    - ✅ Uses Playwright's storageState directly
  
- [x] 8.3: Update browser status indicators
  - **Actual**: 10m
  - **Details**:
    - ✅ Shows "Context: Connected/Not Connected"
    - ✅ Removed "Enhanced Capture" messaging
    - ✅ Session buttons appear when connected
  
- [x] 8.4: Fix critical bug found during testing
  - **Actual**: 5m
  - **Issue**: undefined variable 'connected' on line 185
  - **Fix**: Changed to hardcoded 'launched' mode
  - **Result**: Browser context now connects successfully

### Results
- ✅ Single unified browser system using Playwright
- ✅ No more port 9222 conflicts
- ✅ Browser context captures DOM elements properly
- ✅ Ready for session persistence testing
