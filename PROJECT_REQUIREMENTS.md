# Process Capture Studio - Living Requirements

## üö¶ Current Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-10 11:00 AM  
**Phase**: Building - Window management fixed, need system-wide capture
**Blocked By**: JavaScript errors and lack of system-wide capture
**Next Action**: Fix JS errors then install and integrate iohook for global capture

## üìä Progress Overview
- Total Tasks: 47
- Completed: 23 (49%)
- In Progress: 3
- Discovered: 12 (tasks found during work)
- Failed Attempts: 2

## üéØ Original Vision
[Preserved from initial conversation - NEVER delete, only annotate]

"I want to be able to sit down with my work colleagues and/or a process expert and have a chat on one side that guides through the logic and captures every single important movement in a process. The logic behind it, where it leads, why they got there, how did they get there. The process may go forwards and backwards. Eventually grow to be not needing the person sitting there, but a really cool way of documenting not just the keystrokes and tables but the logic and the insights that can then be passed on to a sophisticated coder to do the work."

**Key Requirements:**
- Capture keystrokes across ALL applications (browser, Excel, desktop)
- Track the "why" not just the "what"
- Handle branching logic (IF file is Excel THEN do X, IF PDF THEN do Y)
- Support backwards navigation to fill gaps
- Export automation-ready code for developers
- Start local with JSON, scale later
- Privacy-first (no actual values stored)

## üîÑ Current Understanding
[How our understanding evolved - update after each session]

- **[2025-01-09 Morning]**: Discovered browser-only capture loses context when switching tabs - need Electron wrapper
- **[2025-01-09 Afternoon]**: Realized Docker can't capture system keystrokes - pivoting to portable Electron app
- **[2025-01-09 Current]**: Three-panel system working beautifully, need system-wide capture via iohook
- **[2025-01-09 Update]**: Recursive data source discovery is KEY - "Where did that come from?" leads to complete automation
- **[2025-08-10 Morning]**: Window management fixed - always-on-top and opacity working perfectly
- **[2025-08-10 Current]**: JS errors preventing proper capture, need iohook for detecting clicks outside app window

## ‚ùå Failed Approaches
[Document what didn't work to save time next time]

### Docker Container Approach
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Time Lost**: 30 minutes
- **Why Failed**: Docker containers can't access host system keystrokes or desktop applications
- **Lesson Learned**: System-level capture requires native access
- **What to Try Instead**: Portable Electron executables

### Browser-Only Capture
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Time Lost**: 1 hour  
- **Why Failed**: Loses context when switching tabs, can't see desktop apps
- **Lesson Learned**: Need system-wide capture for complete solution
- **What to Try Instead**: Electron with iohook for global capture

### iohook Default Installation
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Time Lost**: 45 minutes
- **Why Failed**: iohook prebuilt binaries only support Electron up to v12, we're using v27
- **Lesson Learned**: Version mismatch - 15 major versions gap
- **Investigation**: Reviewed docs at https://wilix-team.github.io/iohook/
- **Solution Plan**:
  - Option B (Primary): Build iohook from source for Electron 27 using manual build instructions
  - Option C (Fallback): Use modern alternatives like uiohook-napi or node-global-key-listener
- **Reference**: Manual build instructions at https://wilix-team.github.io/iohook/manual-build.html
