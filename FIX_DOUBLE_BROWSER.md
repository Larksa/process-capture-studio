# Fixed: Double Browser Launch Issue

## What Was Wrong:
1. Browser worker was **auto-connecting on startup** (launching first Chromium)
2. When you clicked "Connect Browser", it launched a **second Chromium**
3. The app was connected to the wrong browser instance
4. DOM elements weren't being captured because of the confusion

## What I Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ Removed auto-connect on worker startup
2. ‚úÖ Added check to prevent double connection
3. ‚úÖ Killed stray Chromium processes

## How to Use Now:

### 1. Start Fresh:
```bash
# Stop the app if running (Ctrl+C)
# Make sure no stray browsers
pkill -f "Chromium.*playwright"

# Start the app
npm start
```

### 2. Connect Browser (Only One Will Open):
- Click "üåê Connect Browser" button
- **Only ONE Chromium should open** 
- Wait for "Browser: Connected" status

### 3. Test DOM Capture:
1. Navigate to any website (e.g., google.com)
2. Start capture
3. Click on elements
4. Check JSON for selectors

### What to Look For:

**Good - DOM capture working:**
```json
"element": {
  "selectors": {
    "css": "#search-box",
    "id": "search-box",
    "xpath": "//input[@id='search-box']"
  }
},
"pageContext": {
  "url": "https://www.google.com",
  "title": "Google"
}
```

**Bad - DOM capture not working:**
```json
"element": null,
"browserContext": {
  "url": null
}
```

## If Still Having Issues:

### Quick Reset:
```bash
# Complete reset
pkill -f Chromium
pkill -f browser-context-worker
npm start
```

### Console Messages to Watch:
When clicking elements, you should see:
```
[BrowserWorker] Element found: ‚úÖ
[BrowserService] Current page URL: https://...
‚úÖ Enhanced browser context captured
```

If you see:
```
[BrowserWorker] No active page available
```
Then click on the Chromium window to focus it, wait 2 seconds, and try again.

## The Fix Summary:
- **Before**: Worker auto-launched browser + button launched another = 2 browsers
- **After**: Browser only launches when you click button = 1 browser
- **Result**: Proper DOM capture with selectors!

## Next Steps:
1. Test with your ActiveCampaign workflow
2. Confirm selectors are being captured
3. Try the field mapping feature

The double browser issue is now fixed! üéâ
