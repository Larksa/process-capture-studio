- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality

### 2.3 Visual Canvas Builder
- [ ] Implement node drag and drop
- [ ] Add zoom/pan controls
- [ ] Create branch visualization
- [ ] Add node editing capabilities

## Phase 3: Export & Automation (Week 3)
**Goal**: Generate working automation code

### 3.1 Export Formats
- [ ] Playwright export (browser automation)
- [ ] Python/pyautogui export (desktop automation)
- [ ] Markdown documentation export
- [ ] Mermaid flowchart export

### 3.2 Code Generation
- [ ] Selector optimization (ID > class > XPath)
- [ ] Error handling insertion
- [ ] Wait conditions generation
- [ ] Variable extraction for reusable values

### 3.3 Credential Management
- [ ] Detect password fields
- [ ] Create secure placeholders
- [ ] Add credential retrieval options
- [ ] Implement SSO detection

## Phase 4: Distribution (Week 4)
**Goal**: Package for team deployment

### 4.1 Build Process
- [ ] Test Windows build (`npm run build:win`)
- [ ] Test Mac build with code signing
- [ ] Test Linux AppImage build
- [ ] Create portable versions

### 4.2 Installation Experience
- [ ] Add first-run setup wizard
- [ ] Create permission request flow
- [ ] Add configuration templates
- [ ] Build auto-update mechanism

### 4.3 Documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Add video tutorials
- [ ] Write IT deployment guide
- [ ] Create troubleshooting FAQ

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Month 2)
**Goal**: Enterprise-ready features

### 5.1 Advanced Capture
- [ ] OCR for reading screen text
- [ ] API call detection
- [ ] Database query capture
- [ ] File operation tracking

### 5.2 Team Features
- [ ] Process library/sharing
- [ ] Version control integration
- [ ] Collaborative editing
- [ ] Process templates

### 5.3 Analytics & Optimization
- [ ] Time tracking per step
- [ ] Bottleneck detection
- [ ] Process optimization suggestions
- [ ] ROI calculations

## Immediate Priority Actions

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Do First)
1. **Create missing files** to make app runnable
2. **Test basic execution** with `npm start`
3. **Implement minimal capture** (clicks and typing)

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Do Second)
1. **Add export to Playwright** (most requested format)
2. **Test on all platforms** (Windows, Mac, Linux)
3. **Create distribution package**

### ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have (Do Later)
1. **Add OCR capabilities**
2. **Implement cloud sync**
3. **Build marketplace features**

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Success
- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Can capture basic mouse/keyboard
- [ ] Three panels display data correctly

### Week 2 Success  
- [ ] Can mark decision points
- [ ] Visual process map builds automatically
- [ ] Can handle branching logic

### Week 3 Success
- [ ] Exports working Playwright code
- [ ] Handles credential fields safely
- [ ] Generated code runs successfully

### Week 4 Success
- [ ] Distributable packages created
- [ ] Installation documented
- [ ] First external user test successful

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Testing**: No tests exist - add unit tests for ProcessEngine
2. **Error Handling**: Add try-catch blocks and user-friendly errors
3. **Performance**: Optimize for processes with 100+ nodes
4. **Security**: Add input sanitization and XSS prevention
5. **Accessibility**: Add keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Resource Requirements

### Development Tools
- Node.js 16+ and npm 8+
- Electron development environment
- Code signing certificates (Mac/Windows)
- Testing devices/VMs for each platform

### Dependencies to Review
- Consider replacing `iohook` (deprecated) with `uiohook-napi`
- Add `playwright` as optional dependency for testing exports
- Consider `robotjs` as fallback for system capture

### Time Estimates
- Phase 1: 40 hours
- Phase 2: 60 hours  
- Phase 3: 50 hours
- Phase 4: 30 hours
- Phase 5: 80+ hours

**Total MVP**: ~180 hours (4-5 weeks full-time)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Platform permissions**: Document clearly, provide guides
- **Capture library issues**: Have fallback options ready
- **Performance with large processes**: Implement virtualization early

### Business Risks
- **User adoption**: Focus on ease of use, clear value prop
- **Security concerns**: Be transparent about data handling
- **Competition**: Differentiate with "why" capture and visual building

## Next Immediate Step

**Run this command and fix any errors:**
```bash
cd /Users/andrewlarkey/process-capture-studio-app
npm start
```

Then create the three missing files to make the app functional.
