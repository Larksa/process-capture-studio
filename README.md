## 🌟 The Revolution

Stop recording steps. Start capturing intelligence.

**Traditional Process Documentation:**
- ❌ Screenshots and written steps
- ❌ Quickly becomes outdated  
- ❌ Missing the logic and decisions
- ❌ Can't handle variations
- ❌ Developers must interpret and guess

**Process Capture Studio:**
- ✅ Live visual process map builds as you work
- ✅ Captures the "why" behind every action
- ✅ Handles branching logic (IF this THEN that)
- ✅ Tracks data sources and destinations
- ✅ Exports automation-ready code instantly

   - Watch your process build visually!

### Option 2: Run from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/process-capture-studio.git
cd process-capture-studio-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app

```

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🔍 Complete Capture
- **Browser Activity**: Every click, form, navigation
- **Desktop Applications**: Excel, Word, Outlook, any software
- **Keystrokes**: Important key combinations (not passwords!)
- **File Operations**: Which files, where located, what data
- **Cross-Application**: Copy from Excel → Paste to web → Save to file

### 🧠 Intelligence Layer
- **Decision Points**: IF conditions with multiple branches
- **Data Lineage**: Where data comes from and goes
- **Business Rules**: Why actions are taken
- **Validation Logic**: What to check and verify
- **Error Handling**: What to do when things fail

### 🎨 Visual Builder
- **Real-time Canvas**: See your process build live
- **Interactive Nodes**: Click to navigate, drag to reorganize
- **Branching Paths**: Visual IF/THEN/ELSE logic
- **Data Flow Arrows**: See information movement
- **Zoom & Pan**: Handle complex processes easily

### 🤖 Export for Automation
- **Playwright**: Browser automation code with session persistence
- **Python**: Desktop automation scripts
- **Selenium**: Web testing code
- **RPA**: UiPath/Blue Prism compatible
- **Documentation**: Markdown process guides
- **Mermaid**: Flowchart diagrams
- **🍪 Session Persistence**: Capture and replay with authentication intact

## 💡 Use Cases

### 📊 Invoice Processing
Capture the entire workflow:
1. Open email with invoice
2. Save PDF to specific folder
3. Open Excel tracking sheet
4. Copy invoice details
5. Update multiple systems
6. Send confirmation

**Exported as working Python script in seconds!**

### 👤 Customer Onboarding
Document complex multi-system process:
- CRM data entry
- Email verification
- Document generation
- System access setup
- Welcome email sending

**Complete with all decision logic and validation rules!**

### 📈 Report Generation
Capture data gathering from multiple sources:
- Database queries
- Excel manipulations
- Web portal extracts
- Data transformations
- Final report creation

**Including all the "why" and "how" for future automation!**

## 🍪 Session Persistence (Authentication Capture)

Process Capture Studio can capture and replay authenticated sessions, allowing your automations to bypass login screens and work with authenticated applications.

### How It Works
1. **Launch Capture Browser**: Click "🌐 Launch Capture Browser" to start enhanced capture
2. **Login to Your Application**: Navigate and login normally to your target website
3. **Capture Session**: Click "🍪 Capture Session" to save cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage
4. **Continue Recording**: Record your workflow with authentication already in place
5. **Export with Session**: Your exported automation includes the session state

### Security Warning ⚠️

**Session files contain sensitive authentication data** including:
- Login cookies and tokens
- Session storage data
- Local storage contents
- Authentication headers

**Best Practices:**
- Never commit session data to Git repositories
- Treat exported JSON files as passwords
- Only share with trusted parties
- Sessions expire naturally based on website policies
- Use "Clear Session" to remove stored authentication

### Supported Sites
- GitHub (with 2FA)
- Google Workspace
- Microsoft 365
- Custom enterprise applications
- Any site using cookie-based authentication

### Technical Details
The session persistence uses Playwright's `storageState` API to capture the complete browser state. This includes:
- All cookies with their attributes (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- localStorage for all origins
- sessionStorage for all origins
- Works across domains and subdomains

## 🎮 How to Use

### Basic Workflow

#### 1. Start Recording
```
Press: Ctrl+Shift+S or click "Start Capture"
Status: 🔴 Recording appears in top-left
```

#### 2. Mark Important Moments
```
Press: Ctrl+Shift+M at key actions
Popup: "What did you just do?"
Answer: "Copied customer ID from email"
```

#### 3. Handle Decisions
```
When you check something:
System: "What are you checking?"
You: "If customer exists in database"
System: "What are the possible outcomes?"
You: "Exists → Update" or "New → Create"
```

#### 4. Record Each Branch
```
Click the decision node
Select: "Record 'Exists' branch"
Perform those steps
Return and record other branches
```

#### 5. Export Automation
```
Click: Export button
Choose: Playwright / Python / Documentation
Get: Ready-to-run automation code!
```

## 🔀 Advanced Features

### Recursive Data Discovery
When you paste data, the system asks:
- "Where did this come from?"
- "Show me the file" → Records navigation
- "Which cell/field?" → Captures exact location
- Creates complete data lineage

### Credential Handling
Never stores passwords! When detected:
- Creates secure placeholder: `CREDENTIAL_XYZ`
- Asks: "How should automation retrieve this?"
- Options: Prompt, KeyVault, Environment, SSO

### Loop Detection
Recognizes repetitive patterns:
- "Doing this for each row?"
- "Process all files in folder?"
- Automatically creates loop structure

### Time Travel
- Click any node to jump back
- Add missing steps
- Create alternative paths
- Fill gaps in logic

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Can't capture keystrokes"
**Solution**: Check accessibility permissions
- Mac: System Preferences → Security → Privacy → Accessibility
- Windows: Run as Administrator
- Linux: Add user to `input` group

#### "Canvas is slow with many nodes"
**Solution**: Adjust performance settings
```json
{
  "canvas": {
    "virtualization": true,
    "maxVisibleNodes": 50
  }
}
```

#### "Export code doesn't run"
**Solution**: Check dependencies
```bash
# For Playwright export
npm install playwright

# For Python export
pip install pyautogui pandas
```
