## 🔧 Architecture Patterns Discovered

### The "Living Canvas" Pattern
```javascript
// Canvas that builds itself as events happen
class LiveCanvas {
  constructor() {
    eventBus.on('action', this.addNode);
    eventBus.on('decision', this.addBranch);
  }
}
```
**Use case**: Any real-time visualization
**Key insight**: Decouple capture from display

### The "Context Wrapper" Pattern
```javascript
// Every action wrapped with full context
{
  action: { type, target },
  context: { app, window, url },
  logic: { why, rule, fallback },
  data: { from, to, transform }
}
```
**Use case**: Any automation needing reproduction
**Key insight**: Context is more valuable than action

### The "Placeholder Security" Pattern
```javascript
// Never store sensitive data
credential: {
  id: 'CRED_UUID',
  type: 'password',
  retrieval: 'keyring|env|prompt',
  never: actualValue  // NEVER
}
```
**Use case**: Any tool handling credentials
**Key insight**: Separation of identity from value

## 🐛 Problems Solved

## 💡 Breakthrough Moments

### "Click to Time Travel"
Allowing users to click any node and jump back in the process was transformative. It turned linear recording into non-linear exploration.

### "Branches are Just Decorated Edges"
Realizing branches aren't special nodes but decorated connections simplified everything. A decision node just has multiple exit edges with conditions.

### "Data Sources are Recursive"
The recursive "where from?" pattern unlocked complete automation. Every paste leads to a copy, every copy to a source, every source to a reason.

### "Context Beats Content"
Capturing WHERE and WHY something happened is more valuable than WHAT was typed. "Entered customer name" vs "Copied from cell B15 in yesterday's report because it's the latest verified data."

## 🚫 What Didn't Work

### Attempt: Docker containerization
- **Why it failed**: Can't access host system events
- **Time wasted**: 30 minutes
- **Lesson**: System-level = native access required
- **Alternative**: Portable Electron executables

### Attempt: Single-panel design
- **Why it failed**: Too much context switching
- **Time wasted**: 1 hour
- **Lesson**: Parallel views reduce cognitive load
- **Alternative**: Three-panel system

### Attempt: Auto-capturing everything
- **Why it failed**: Too much noise, important stuff lost
- **Time wasted**: 2 hours
- **Lesson**: Intentional capture > automatic capture
- **Alternative**: Hotkey-triggered important moments

### Attempt: iohook with modern Electron (default install)
- **Why it failed**: Prebuilt binaries only support Electron ≤12, we used v27
- **Time wasted**: 45 minutes
- **Lesson**: Always check version compatibility matrix FIRST
- **Key Learning**: 15 major version gap - prebuilt binaries don't exist
- **Solution**: Build from source using https://wilix-team.github.io/iohook/manual-build.html
- **Alternative**: Modern libraries like uiohook-napi or node-global-key-listener
- **Important**: iohook itself is excellent software, just needs compilation for modern Electron

## 🔧 Native Module Compatibility Lessons

### Key Learning: Version Matrix is Critical
When using native modules (C++ addons) with Electron:
1. **Check supported versions FIRST** - Don't assume latest works
2. **Prebuilt binaries have limits** - Often lag behind Electron releases
3. **Building from source is normal** - Not a failure, just part of the process
4. **Version gaps matter** - 15 major versions = completely different ABI

### Pattern: Native Module Integration
```
1. Check module's Electron version support
2. If mismatch: 
   a. Try building from source (Option B)
   b. Use alternative module (Option C)
   c. Downgrade Electron (Option A - last resort)
3. Document build process for team
```

### iohook Specific Lessons
- **Quality**: Excellent library, well-documented, good API
- **Issue**: Prebuilt binaries stopped at Electron 12 (we need 27)
- **Solution Path**: 
  1. Build from source: https://wilix-team.github.io/iohook/manual-build.html
  2. Alternative: uiohook-napi or node-global-key-listener
- **Time Investment**: Worth building from source for full capability

## 🎯 Patterns for Knowledge Base

### Pattern: Progressive Process Capture
```
1. Capture linear flow
2. Add decision points
3. Record each branch
4. Fill gaps retroactively
5. Add validation rules
```

### Pattern: Three-Layer Automation Data
```
Layer 1: Actions (what happened)
Layer 2: Context (where/when)
Layer 3: Logic (why/how)
```

### Pattern: Visual-First Development
```
Show it building → User understands → User trusts → User adopts
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements Discovered

### Needs from users:
1. **Loop detection**: "I do this for each row"
2. **Parallel paths**: "While that loads, I do this"
3. **Error branches**: "If this fails, I try that"
4. **Validation points**: "I check if it worked"
5. **Data transformation**: "I clean it first"

### Technical opportunities:
1. **OCR integration**: Read screen content
2. **AI suggestions**: "Looks like a loop here"
3. **Pattern library**: Common workflows
4. **Team sharing**: Process marketplace
5. **Version control**: Process evolution

### Solved the "context problem"
Capturing why/where/how along with what makes automation possible.

### Made complexity manageable
Branching logic that seemed complex is intuitive when visualized.

### Achieved "wow" factor
Seeing the process build live while working is magical.

## 💎 Most Valuable Learning

**The magic is in the connection between action and intent.** Capturing what someone does is easy. Understanding why they do it, where the data comes from, what happens if it fails - that's where automation becomes possible.

The three-panel system isn't just UI - it's a mental model:
- **See what's happening** (Activity)
- **Understand why** (Chat)
- **Visualize the flow** (Canvas)

This trinity creates understanding that neither alone could achieve.
