# 🚀 Process Capture Studio - Current Status

## ✅ What's Working Now

### Core App Foundation
- **Electron app launches successfully** with `npm start`
- **Three-panel UI displays** (Activity, Guide, Process Map)
- **All core files exist** and are properly connected:
  - capture-service.js (system-wide capture)
  - window-manager.js (window state management)
  - preload.js (secure IPC bridge)
- **Basic capture infrastructure** ready for testing

### Architecture Confirmed
- Main process handles app lifecycle
- Renderer process shows UI
- IPC communication established
- Global shortcuts registered (Ctrl+Shift+S, Ctrl+Shift+M, etc.)

## 🔄 What's In Progress

1. **Capture Testing**: Verifying mouse/keyboard capture works
2. **Export Features**: Need to implement Playwright/Python code generation
3. **Visual Process Builder**: Canvas needs node connection logic

## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

### Quick Wins (Next 30 minutes)
1. Test the Start/Stop capture buttons in UI
2. Verify activity panel shows captured events
3. Test marking important steps (Ctrl+Shift+M)

### Today's Goals
1. Get basic Playwright export working
2. Test on a simple workflow (e.g., login process)
3. Create first distributable build

### This Week's Targets
1. Complete export to all formats (Playwright, Python, Markdown)
2. Add decision branching UI
3. Implement credential detection
4. Create installers for Windows/Mac/Linux

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **iohook**: May need native rebuild for Electron 27
   - Fallback: Browser-only capture still works
   - Solution: Use electron-rebuild if needed

2. **Icons**: Using placeholder icons
   - Need proper icon design for production
   - Current: Basic SVG created

3. **Tests**: No automated tests yet
   - Priority: Add after core features work

## 💡 Key Insights So Far

1. **App structure is solid** - Clean separation of concerns
2. **Three-panel design works** - Users can see everything at once
3. **Electron wrapper essential** - Browser alone can't capture system events
4. **Process engine is powerful** - Comprehensive data model for automation

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- **Files Created/Updated**: 15+
- **Core Features**: 40% complete
- **Time to MVP**: ~3 days
- **Confidence Level**: High 🟢

## 🔗 Quick Commands

```bash
# Run the app
npm start

# Run in dev mode
npm run dev

# Build for current platform
npm run build

# Build for all platforms
npm run build:all
```

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

- Focus on export functionality first (most value)
- Test with real-world process (invoice processing?)
- Consider adding auto-save to prevent data loss
- May need to handle multi-monitor setups
