# Browser Restart Test Guide

## Testing Browser Restart Functionality

### Steps to Test:

1. **Start the App**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Connect Browser**
   - Click the "🌐 Connect Browser" button
   - A Chromium browser window will open
   - Button should change to "✅ Connected"
   - Status should show "🟢 Browser: Connected"

3. **Close the Browser**
   - Close the Chromium browser window manually (click the X button)
   - Watch the app UI for changes

4. **Expected Behavior After Closing Browser:**
   - Status should automatically update to "🔴 Browser: Disconnected"
   - Button should re-enable and show "🌐 Connect Browser"
   - Activity feed should show: "🔴 Browser disconnected - Click 'Connect Browser' to reconnect"
   - Session capture buttons should hide

5. **Reconnect Browser**
   - Click "🌐 Connect Browser" again
   - Button should show "⏳ Reconnecting..." while connecting
   - A new Chromium browser window should open
   - Status should return to "🟢 Browser: Connected"
   - Button should show "✅ Connected"

### What's New:
- Browser disconnect is automatically detected when you close the browser window
- The UI immediately updates to show disconnected state
- You can reconnect without restarting the app
- Clear feedback in the activity feed about browser state changes

### Console Logs to Watch:
```
[BrowserWorker] Browser disconnected event detected
[Main] Browser disconnected notification received
[App] Browser status update: { connected: false, message: 'Browser disconnected' }
[connectBrowser] Reconnecting to browser after disconnection...
```

### Troubleshooting:
- If the button doesn't re-enable after closing browser, check console for errors
- If reconnection fails, try refreshing the app (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
- Make sure no other Chromium instances are interfering
